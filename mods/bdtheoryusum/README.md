# BD-Theorymon-New
Code dump for [Gen 7] BD Theorymon New

Mods: http://bdbattlers.crazy4us.com/t49-gen-7-bd-theorymon-new-modifications

formats.js at 'config' folder

rulesets.js at 'data' folder

everything else at 'mod' folder with new folder name 'bdnew'

To add custom Megas, alter a competitively useless item from 'items.js' and add the Mega in 'pokedex.js' in Line 45 of 'scripts.js'

e.g. Bluk Berry in items.js, Machamp-Mega in pokedex.js

formats-data.js doesn't need entry of the custom Mega. It is only for releasing unreleased Pokémon and determining which Pokémon stays in which tier.
